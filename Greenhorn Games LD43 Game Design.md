# Greenhorn Games MMU LD43 Unity-based Game. 
## (THIS FILE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, CURRENTLY IN NOTE FORM)
## LD43 Theme: Sacrifices must be made   
---
### Game Description:
Dungeon Platformer that is tile-based,  dungeons in general will naturally suit a "sacrifice" game. This will be a level-based 2D dungeon-crawler with a focus on dungeon clearing & exploration (with the end goal to defeat the levels final boss; using the skills you have learnt about **weaknesses** from the corresponding level).

---

### Monsters:
We could design some levels based around monster type, with each NPC having a unique attack style
First level for example could be goblin populated using the goblins given in the sheet

With the end-goal of that level to kill the boss version of their kind in that sheet:

Same thing for the same level, based around this creature type instead.

### Depth 

E.g. - Dagger vs clothed looking sprite
        - Mace vs armored sprite
        - Sword vs leather(edited)
We could start a player with a dagger or so, have them clear a camp of clothies with a chest that has a sword in it, they will then want to use their sword as it looks better than a dagger I suppose (which will lead them onto the next camp of leather wearers)
Do the same with the mace in a different way, so they're likely to use it on the plate wearers.
